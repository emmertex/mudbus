History
===

Mudbus was started by Dee Wykoff, and ported to Arduino 1.0 by Martin Petterson

Then came Siamect, origionally on gitorious, who turned it into a well featured client.
At some point, it moved to github.

While it was on gitorious I added error checking and proper complient fault codes.

And I just went looking for it, and hence re-forked it from siamect.
